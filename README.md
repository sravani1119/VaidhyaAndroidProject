## Problem Statement
Healthcare brand loyalty is declining as today's healthcare consumers demand greater convenience. 1 This means that patients who were once loyal to a particular healthcare provider or group will switch doctors for a better experience — and many have already done so. In fact, more than one-third of patients have switched healthcare providers in the last two years, with a lack of access cited as the primary reason.

## Introduction
When patients have the option of booking or requesting an appointment online, they can do so whenever it is convenient for them — without having to call your front desk or scheduler during business hours or play phone tag. When your phone line is busy or your office is closed, online scheduling can help you convert android application visitors into new patients. and you can easliy search for an doctor appointment with in your place with the help of our Vaidhya application.
